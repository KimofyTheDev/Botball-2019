[X]Timer countdown begins as soon as light is on\
[X]Timer is set to countdown for 119000ms (119 seconds)\
---Time is set to 119 seconds to avoid accidental overtime

\*_This will be used as the base, or starting file, for both robots. It will then be modified for the specific needs of each robot._

_[âœ“] - Denotes task complete; [X] Denotes task incomplete_

### EVERYONE:
Document all functions with uses and examples, especially during commits.

**All code should and MUST be pushed to Github as it's developed.** Botball requires our code to remain up-to-date on Github. Contact me (Syed - sahmad4767@fdrhs.org) if you are a coder and do not have access to the Github Repo, and I'll have you set up.

If you do not know how to properly use Github, also contact me and I can show you how to use the neccesary commands so you're good to go
